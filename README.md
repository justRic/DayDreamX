## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> You **can not** host DDX locally via a static web hosting site
> such as Netlify, Github Pages, and Cloudflare Pages.

We recommend using the Bun package manager to install DayDreamX's dependencies. However, DayDreamX contains lock files for three major package managers: npm, pnpm, and bun.

Please run the following commands to host a server:

```
git clone https://github.com/NightProxy/DayDreamX.git
cd DayDreamX
npm i
npm start
```

In the above example, replace `npm` with `bun` or `pnpm` for whichever package manager you wish to use.

### Updating

```
git pull --force --allow-unrelated-histories
```
